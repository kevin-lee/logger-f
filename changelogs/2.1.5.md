## Done
* [`logger-f-logback-mdc-monix3`] Bump `logback-scala-interop` to `1.5.0` and `logback` to `1.5.5` (#570)

  Since `logback` `1.5.1`, `LoggerContext.setMDCAdapter` allows setting the inner `mdcAdapter: MDCAdapter` more than once. Previously, assigning a new `mdcAdapter` only worked when `mdcAdapter` was `null`.
  
  So, `LoggerContext.setMDCAdapter` is used instead of reflection to set `Monix3MdcAdapter` as `LoggerContext`'s `mdcAdapter`.
