## [2.0.0-beta22](https://github.com/kevin-lee/logger-f/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3Av2-m1+closed%3A2023-10-02..2023-11-07) - 2023-11-08

## Change

* Change the `LogMessage` parameter in the `log(F[A])` method from `NotIgnorable` to `MaybeIgnorable` (#498)
  This could be required and useful for case like

  ```scala
  final case class Something(id: Int, name: String)
  
  val fa: F[Something] = ...
  Log[F].log(fa) {
    case Something(0, _) => ignore
    case Something(n, name) => info(s"Something: id=$n, name=$name")
  }
  ```

## Improvement

* Remove unnecessary re-evaluation of `String` in `logS` (#500)
  `msg()` and `message` (call-by-name) below in line 61 (Scala 2) and line 62 (Scala 3) were replaced with a single lazy evaluation.
